# Mac Facility Maintenance System

This project deals with the maintenance of the University of Texas at Arlington's Mac Facility Maintenace System. Mac is a recreational centre for students, staff and faculty of UTA. It contains a number of different rooms and courts that are used for different indoor and outdoor sports. 

A person can register into the Mac Facility Maintenance System as a User (Students and Faculty), a Facility Manager, a Repairer or an Admin and login into the system. 

A User can submit a Maintenance Action Report (MAR) on a room. A Maintenance Action report is a detailed report on the repairs needed by the facility. Whenever a User submits a MAR, a MAR number is automatically assigned to it.

A facility manager deals the management of submitted MARs and the allocation of resources needed for repairing the facility 

A repairer is assigned by the facility manager to a facility. They can book a slot for working on the assigned repairs of the facilities depending on the deadlines associated with each MAR.

An admin has privilege to modify the details of the other users submitted in the registration form.
